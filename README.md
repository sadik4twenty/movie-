Squid Game Season 3: What We Know So Far

Following the global phenomenon of Squid Game, fans are eagerly awaiting the release of Season 3, which promises to raise the stakes even higher. After the success of Season 2 (currently in production as of 2025), creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has confirmed that Season 3 is already in early development, with discussions about new games, deeper character arcs, and a global expansion of the deadly competition.

Season 3 is expected to follow Seong Gi-hun’s transformation, as he sets out to challenge the game’s creators rather than participate again. This marks a shift from survival to rebellion, potentially introducing a new underground resistance, hidden truths about the Front Man’s role, and the global network behind the games.

Rumors suggest we may also see international versions of the Squid Game, exploring how other countries adapt their own childhood games into brutal tests of survival. Fans are also hoping for flashbacks that reveal more about the origin of the games and the mysterious VIPs.

While no official release date has been announced, if production follows the current pace, Squid Game Season 3 could arrive by late 2026 or early 2027. Until then, fans can only speculate — but one thing is certain: the game is far from over.
